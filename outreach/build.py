 "demo": "Set up in a public space, let people drive, and answer the same six questions two hundred times. The lowest-friction outreach there is.",

 "fllmentor": "Ten weeks with a rookie FLL team. You are there so the coach is not alone with the robot game rules.",
 "ftcmentor": "Technical mentoring for a rookie FTC or FRC team through their build season. The hardest and most valuable thing on this board.",
 "judge": "Work a qualifier as a volunteer. You see how judging actually works from the other side, which changes how your own team presents.",
 "girlsday": "A half-day event for girls who have not been told robotics is for them. The mentors on the floor matter more than the activity.",
 "cad": "Teach enough CAD that someone can model a bracket and print it. Two hours gets a beginner to a real part.",
 "code": "An hour of block or text programming for beginners. Bring the robot so they see where the code eventually goes.",
 "print3d": "A printer, a table, and a bin of failed prints. People will watch a whole print finish, which is more attention than you can usually buy.",
 "panel": "Fifty minutes in a classroom. Talk about the season you lost, not the one you won -- it lands better and it is more useful.",
 "pettingzoo": "A booth at a public event with the robot driveable all day. High reach, hard on the drivers, worth a rotation schedule.",
 "parade": "The robot on a trailer, students walking alongside with flyers. Pure visibility; plan for the battery dying at mile two.",
 "gobabygo": "Modify a ride-on toy car so a toddler with limited mobility can drive it independently. A therapist measures the child; you build to that.",
 "toyadapt": "Wire a 3.5mm switch jack into a battery toy so a child using an adaptive switch can play with it. Cheap, fast, and genuinely used.",
 "safety": "PPE, tool basics, and what actually happens when you skip a step. Teach only tools you are certified on.",
 "sponsor": "Forty-five minutes with a company. Students present, the mentor stays quiet, and you leave a one-pager with real numbers on it.",
 "camp": "A week of camp you plan and run. The largest single commitment here and the one that produces the most repeat families.",
 "familynight": "Six stations, two hours, parents included. Translate the handouts or half the room cannot participate.",
 "scrimmage": "Host an offseason event. Enormous logistics; it makes your team the hub of the regional community for a day.",
 "cleanup": "A service shift at a food bank, shelter, or trail. Not robotics, and it still counts -- Impact asks what you do for your community.",
 "translate": "Translate activity sheets or your own curriculum into a language families in your district actually speak. A native speaker must review it.",
 "seniortech": "Sit with seniors and help with phones and tablets. End by showing the robot so it is not purely a help desk.",
 "startteam": "Walk a school from zero to a registered team: adult champion, budget, grant, first order. Twelve months of work that outlives you.",
 "press": "Get a local outlet to run a story. You need a hook and a photo, not a press release.",
 "grant": "Write and submit an outreach grant. Eight hours that can fund a whole year of the activities on this board.",
 "hospitalvisit": "Bring a small, quiet robot to a pediatric ward, led entirely by Child Life staff. Clearance takes months; do not improvise.",
 "toolkit": "Give a rookie team working tools and shop time. Inventory what you have spare first so you are not donating junk.",
 "boothfair": "A recruiting table at a school or club fair. The point is the sign-up sheet, so make someone own it.",

 "adaptivecontrol": "Build a game controller around one person's specific physical needs, then go back and fix the fit after they use it.",
